# ScreenCasting

## Description

Our project is about sharing screens with people and allowing them to text to each other while on it. We are also implementing a voice chat feautre in our project. 

## Getting started

### Install
Clone the url and import it to eclipse.


### How to Run

Right click on the project from eclipse and click run.
Next, follow the instructions on the console.

* For the host, type: server (port) - without brackets (port can be any integer between 1024 and 65534).	Ex. localhost>>> server 10000
 	
* For the client, type: client (server IP address) (server port) - without brackets.	Ex. localhost>>> client 127.0.0.1 10000

## Features 
1. Share Screen
2. Text Chat (Future work)
3. Voice Chat (Future work)

Due to the lack of funding, we had to use a free recording software which resulted with watermarks in the video.
